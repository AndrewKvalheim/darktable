  crash darktable.

## Notes

- We now display a big red messages for cameras having missing
  samples. The camera that were removed in 3.8.0 are back in darktable
  for a short period of time.

  If you see the red message then your camera is missing samples. If
  you do nothing it will get removed for good in next darktable major
  release.
